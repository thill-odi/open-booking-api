This document specifies an HTTP API for placing bookings to participate in
physical activities, either by attending events or through the use of leisure
or sports facilities.

Contributions to this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited
and should be made via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api/issues) and
pull requests. The source code is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api).

<div class="note">
This document represents a complete Editors Draft. It is currently in the final stages of community review and we hope that it is nearing stability. The draft is intended to allow developers to provide feedback by developing proof-of-concept implementations. We encourage developers to explore this API and
contribute to the development of the specification.
</div>

</section>

<section class="informative">

# Introduction

The document is an output of the
[OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/). As part
of the [OpenActive](https://openactive.io) initiative, the community group is
developing standards that will promote the publication and use of open
[opportunity data](https://openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#categories-of-physical-activity-data)
in helping people to become more physically active.

The Community Group have already published specifications that define standard
data models ([[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]]) and support the publication and
harvesting of data in standard formats ([[RPDE]]). This existing work helps increase the discovery of opportunities for people to
be active.

<dfn>Opportunities</dfn> to be active (e.g. "Yoga Tuesday 14th 7pm"), which include `SessionSeries`, `FacilityUse` and `Slot` and their associated `Offer`s (e.g. "Junior (8-18) Â£9"), are both defined by this existing work.

This specification builds on that work by defining an HTTP API that
can be implemented by <a>Booking Systems</a> that are publishing opportunity data. By
allowing third-party applications ("<a>Brokers</a>"). to place bookings in their systems, it becomes
 possible for more people to participate in events or make use of leisure and
 sporting facilities.

The specification defines the flow of HTTP requests and responses between the
<a>Booking System</a> (server) and the <a>Broker</a> (client). This includes
definitions of the overall application flow, detailed request and response
formats and the potential error conditions that applications may encounter.

## Scope and requirements

The current scope of the specification should conform to a set of
[use cases and requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fsCr071V12i_2g0DK818OAGlEAJFLWwkBp9bpgx4fo8/edit?usp=sharing)
that have previously been identified and discussed with the OpenActive
community.

The focus of the initial versions of this specification will be on the simplest use cases that will support making bookings on behalf of users.

The core functionality includes:

* __Guest checkout__ â making a booking on behalf of a <a>Customer</a> who is assumed to be unknown to the <a>Booking System</a> and <a>Seller</a>, and who does not expect a persistent account to be created for them with the <a>Seller</a>.
* __Pricing and availability__ â checking the price and current availabilty of an event or for the use of a facility.
* __Booking__ â recording bookings in the <a>Booking System</a>.
* __Tax__ â tax calculation by the <a>Booking System</a> exposed to the <a>Broker</a>.
* __Multiple order items__ - handling bookings for multiple events ("shopping carts") and for groups of users.
* __Child booking__ - booking on behalf of a child.
* __Dynamic pricing__ â allowing the <a>Broker</a> to vary pricing, where agreed with the <a>Seller</a>.
* __Cancellation__ â <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a> initiated cancellation .
* __Access control__ - text, images and barcodes that can be used by the <a>Customer</a> to access the activity.

Additional optional functionality includes:

* __Leasing__ â temporarily reserving spaces for a user to attend an event or
make use of a facility, whilst placing a booking.
* __Booking approval__ â optional approval for <a>Booking Systems</a> that support or require approval for bookings.


### Out of Scope in this version

A number of additional requirements that relate to the booking of events and facilities are currently out of scope:

* creating and managing accounts for <a>Customers</a>
* more complex pricing options, e.g. membership-based pricing
* waiting lists for events
* collecting marketing preferences from the <a>Customer</a>
* business-to-business tax calculation
* cancellation fees
* "subscriptions" to allow a <a>Customer</a> to participate ad-hoc in a <a>Seller</a>'s activity, with such participation recorded for later reconciliation
* refunds/cancellations after the opportunity has occurred 
* back-office systems between <a>Broker</a> and <a>Booking System</a>, such as for payment reconciliation
* fine-grained control of opportunity bookability in the <a>Booking System</a>

It is possible that future versions of this specification may include support
for these or other features. Revisions will be driven by the needs of the
community, please raise feature requests via [GitHub](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api).


### Out of Scope by design

By design this specification will not define some types of functionality.

These have been declared as permanently out of scope because they are either
adequately covered by existing specifications, or will be covered by future
work of the OpenActive Community Group.

The functionality that is currently defined as out of scope includes:

* __API authentication and security__ â while the specification recommends some best practices relating to authentication and security it does not mandate a specific means of securing an API. Implementers are free to choose the system that offers the best security for their platform and users.
* __Payment processing__ â the design assumes that all payment handling will be coordinated by the <a>Broker</a>, in a separate payment flow. <a>Brokers</a> are able to use the payment and reconciliation mechanisms that provide the best options for their <a>Sellers</a> and <a>Customers</a>.
* __API business models__ â the design is agnostic to any business models that might govern the use or provision of the API, e.g. revenue-sharing or transaction processing fees.
* __Opportunity discovery__  â finding, filtering and searching for opportunity data. This specification assumes that the client and server applications have already shared data about the relevant opportunities, e.g. via an [[RPDE]] feed containing [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] data.
* __API endpoint discovery__  â the <a>Broker</a> finding and connecting to the API endpoints included in this specification are included in the [[Dataset-API-Discovery]] specification.

## Specification dependencies

Version 1.0 of the Open Booking specification depends on the following:
- [[RPDE]] Version 1.x
- [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] Version 2.x

Note that the versions are constrained only to major version releases (breaking changes), and that the flexibility provided by supporting minor versions enables implementors to take advantage of additional features as the specifications evolve.

<div class="issue" data-number="105"></div>

## Audience

The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:

- Software developers who want to implement the API, e.g. as part of a <a>Booking System</a>
- Software developers building client libraries or tools
- Software developers writing applications that will use the API ("<a>Brokers</a>") 

The following sections introduce terminology, concepts and requirements that
underpin the design of the API. This content might also be useful for a wider
audience, e.g. business analysts or product managers looking for a high-level
overview of the API functionality.

# Key Actors

Of all the organisations and systems involved in a transaction, the API defined
by this specification is scoped tightly to only specify interactions between the <a>Broker</a> and
<a>Booking System</a>, with high level prompts for interactions with <a>Customers</a> and <a>Payment Providers</a>.

# Booking Flows

This specification includes two main booking flows: a Simple Booking Flow, and a Booking Flow with Approval that builds on the Simple Booking Flow. Both have the same set of pre-conditions.

## Booking pre-conditions

In order to enter either of the booking flows described in this specification, the following pre-conditions must be met:

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST obtain opportunity data that includes descriptions of <a>Opportunities</a>, by frequently harvesting data via opportunity data [[RPDE]] open feeds provided by the <a>Booking System</a>.

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST present an up-to-date view of availability data for the <a>Customer</a> to select items to book, as this data may change over time.

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST ensure that the `remainingAttendeeCapacity` and `remainingUses` properties in the opportunity data are up-to-date.

- The <a>Customer</a> MUST have selected at least one <a>bookable</a> pair of an <a>Opportunity</a> ("Yoga Tuesday 14th 7pm") with an associated `Offer` ("Junior (8-18) Â£9"). These pairs populate the `orderedItem` and `acceptedOffer` properties within the submitted `OrderItem`s, respectively.


## Simple Booking Flow

### Customer Journey
The booking journey of a <a>Customer</a> is generalised into the following logical steps:

<figure>
 <img src="userjourney.png" alt="High level user journey">
 <figcaption>Illustration of a typical <a>Customer</a> journey.</figcaption>
</figure>

1. **Select**: <a>Customer</a> selects at least one <a>Opportunity</a> (e.g. `ScheduledSession` or `Slot`) and an associated `Offer` ("Junior (8-18) Â£9")
2. **Identify**: <a>Customer</a> submits personal details and other requested details
3. **Book and Pay**: <a>Customer</a> submits payment details

Note that some or all steps may be skipped, or may not be presented to the user, e.g. if their registration or payment details are already known, or they are using a voice interface. These steps are not indicative of the user experience, and simply provide a common language around the flow.

### High-level API flow

<figure>
 <img src="bookingflow.png" alt="High level booking flow">
 <figcaption>Illustration of high level booking flow.</figcaption>
</figure>

- The <a>Broker</a> generates a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) which is used to uniquely identify the `Order` throughout the process.

- After "**1. Select**" the <a>Broker</a> calls the <a>Booking System</a> to confirm an indicative price and the availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, and retrieve a total order price. Any details that the <a>Customer</a> needs to supply to complete the booking are also specified. This is checkpoint **C1** on the diagram above.

- After "**2. Identify**" the <a>Broker</a> calls the <a>Booking System</a> to reconfirm the price and availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, using all personal details required, and retrieve a total order price. Explicit consent for any terms and conditions is also captured at this stage if required. This is checkpoint **C2** on the diagram above.

- After "**3. Book and Pay**", the <a>Broker</a> first _pre-authorizes_ the payment for the total order price (if required by the <a>Payment Provider</a>), then confirms the booking with the <a>Booking System</a> using an `Order` (**B** on the diagram above), and finally _captures_ the payment. The <a>Broker</a> then generates invoices, and sends the <a>Customer</a> notifications.

- The <a>Booking System</a> adds the `Order` to an <a>Orders feed</a> specific to the <a>Broker</a>, which the <a>Broker</a> reads to update its internal state, including those updates resulting from cancellations.


### Leasing

Customers may simultaneously attempt to book the same <a>Opportunity</a> (e.g. space in an event or `Slot` of a facility), and hence contend with one another for a limited number of opportunities. In order to ensure that items cannot be "stolen" from a <a>Customer</a>'s "shopping basket" by another <a>Customer</a>, some <a>Booking Systems</a> use the concept of a <dfn>lease</dfn>, a temporary reservation that provides a window during which a <a>Customer</a> can complete their customer journey and improves the user experience overall.

The design of this API supports the use of time-bound leases. Using leases is RECOMMENDED, however they are not required, in order to ensure a low barrier of entry for implementers of the specification.

Individually at **C1** and **C2**, the <a>Booking System</a> can opt to create (or extend) a lease for the <a>Broker</a>. Whether they opt to do so may depend on the <a>Booking System</a>'s capacity to support leases, or on the <a>Seller</a>'s configuration of the <a>Booking System</a>. At **C1** the lease is anonymous, while at **C2** <a>Customer</a> details and any other additional details are provided.

If a lease is created at **C1** and/or **C2** it is used during **B**. However, if no lease is created, or if it had expires prior to the transaction being completed, the booking completes anyway provided sufficient inventory is available.

It is RECOMMENDED that if the <a>Booking System</a> supports leasing, it also guarantees the price of each leased item for the duration of the lease, so that the <a>Customer</a> is guaranteed to pay the price they have seen during **C2**.

The specification is designed to be flexible with regard to leasing: should a <a>Booking System</a> be upgraded to support leasing, it can do so without affecting the <a>Broker</a>'s implementation.

By design, the use of leases is largely transparent to the <a>Broker</a>, however the <a>Booking System</a> MUST provide information on the lease to help improve the user experience of the customer journey as follows: when a lease is created, a `Lease` object MUST be returned in the `OrderQuote`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of lease">
  "lease": {
    "type": "Lease",
    "leaseExpires": "2018-10-01T11:00:00Z"
  }
</pre>

The `leaseExpires` MAY be used to inform the <a>Customer</a> of the time they have remaining.

### High-level type flow

<figure>
 <img src="typeflow.png" alt="High level type flow">
 <figcaption>Illustration of types used during the API flow.</figcaption>
</figure>

The `OrderQuote` is an ephemeral draft of the `Order` while it is being constructed by the <a>Customer</a>.

- **C1** - `OrderQuote` without enough personal details or additional details to be accepted as an `Order`.
- **C2** - `OrderQuote` with complete and validated detail, enough to be created successfully as an `Order`.
- **B** - `Order` exists in an instantly successful state in the <a>Booking System</a>, though it transitions through `orderCreationStatus` states in the <a>Broker</a>.

### Order statuses

To simplify the implementation for the <a>Booking System</a>, Order Creation is considered atomic to the <a>Booking System</a> (it succeeds or fails at once in **B**), and by contrast is considered to consist of steps to the <a>Broker</a>. 

#### Order statuses in the Booking System

In this version of the specification the `Order` within the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT have a status, it exists atomically in a successfully created state. Although `OrderItem`s may be cancelled by either the <a>Customer</a> or the <a>Seller</a>, the `Order` itself within the <a>Booking System</a> is simply a container. The `orderStatus` property of the `Order` MUST NOT be used and is reserved for future evolution of the specification.

The `orderCreationStatus` is maintained by the <a>Broker</a> only during this flow, and MUST NOT be sent to the <a>Booking System</a>.

#### Order statuses in the Broker

Throughout "Book and Pay" section of this flow the <a>Broker</a> maintains the `orderCreationStatus` property in its copy of the `Order`, which is not sent to the <a>Booking System</a>. This allows the <a>Broker</a> to consistently rollback in the case of failure.

The `orderCreationStatus` statuses are defined as follows:
1. https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized - after successful **Payment Authorisation**
2. https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentDue - after successful **Order Creation / B**
3. https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured - after successful **Payment Capture**
4. https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete - after successful **Invoice Generation** and **Customer Notification**

An `Order` MUST NOT be displayed by the <a>Broker</a> and other operations such as cancellation MUST NOT be possible until it has reached the `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete`, after which the `orderCreationStatus` can be completely ignored.


### Step-by-step process description

<figure>
 <img src="sequencediagram.png" alt="Sequence diagram">
 <figcaption>Sequence diagram showing API interactions</figcaption>
</figure>


i) "**1. Select**" - User browses <a>Broker</a> site anonymously and adds something to basket

  - <a>Broker</a> MUST have determined at least one Open Booking <a>bookable</a> opportunity each with an associated applicable `Offer` from the user's browsing, using the most up-to-date opportunity data.
  - <a>Broker</a> generates a UUID to use for the `Order`.
  - If any catastrophic failure occurs during the booking flow (any error with status code 500, or when the request consistently returns status code 503 after a number of retries) the UUID MUST be regenerated to allow for a clean retry of the booking. UUID MUST NOT be regenerated for expected errors (status code 4xx).

ii) **OrderQuote Creation / C1** - <a>Broker</a> call with `OrderQuote` including UUID without a `customer` object to check availability and that the combination of items requested can be purchased, <a>Booking System</a> responds with an `OrderQuote` including any `error`s against each `OrderItem`.

  - <a>Booking System</a> creates anonymous lease for that UUID if it is supported, otherwise it provides a simple availability and `totalPaymentDue` confirmation. An `OrderQuote` response with HTTP Status 200 will be returned if the all requested items are available. If a lease has been created, then the `OrderQuote` in the response MUST include a `lease` property containing a valid `Lease` object.
  - `OrderQuote` MUST include `totalPaymentDue`, which allows the <a>Broker</a> to update any UI with the total.
  - `OrderQuote` MUST include a list of `OrderItem`s which contain their respective <a>Opportunity</a> objects, including enough detail to allow the <a>Broker</a> to display information about the <a>Opportunity</a> to the <a>Customer</a> (rather than relying on the <a>Broker</a> having the most up-to-date <a>Opportunity</a> data from the open feeds at the point of purchase).
  - The <a>Booking System</a> MUST ensure that the data returned to the <a>Broker</a> in the `remainingAttendeeCapacity` and `remainingUses` properties are up-to-date, including places already booked and those currently reserved by any leases from competing `OrderQuote`s.
  - `OrderQuote` MUST specify any additional details required to complete the booking for the selected `OrderItem`s via a `orderItemIntakeForm`.
  - If there are any issues with the `OrderItem`s requested in the `OrderQuote`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `409 Conflict` response, with `error` details provided against each offending `OrderItem`. 
  - The <a>Booking System</a> MUST reflect back all properties defined by this specification that are supplied by the <a>Broker</a>'s request in its response, including `broker` and `brokerRole`, to acknowledge they have been recognised (even if they have not actually been stored by the <a>Booking System</a>). The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT reflect back extension properties outside of this specification unless it explicitly supports them.

iii) "**2. Identify**" - User enters personal details and any other additional details requested

  - The <a>Customer</a> MUST have been informed that their personal information is being submitted to the <a>Seller</a>.
  - The <a>Customer</a> MUST have been made aware of any relevant `termsOfService`, for example by displaying a link to them prominently, before submitting their personal details.
  - If `requiresExplicitConsent` is `true` for any `termsOfService` then the <a>Customer</a> MUST only be allowed to proceed if they have explicitly acted to assent to such terms.

iv) **OrderQuote Creation / C2** - <a>Broker</a> call with `OrderQuote` including UUID with a `customer` object and any `orderItemIntakeFormResponse` required, <a>Booking System</a> responds with an `OrderQuote` including any `error`s against each `OrderItem`.

  - <a>Booking System</a> creates named lease for that UUID if it is supported, otherwise it provides a simple availability and `totalPaymentDue` confirmation. Works exactly as **C1**, except validates `customer` details and the `orderItemIntakeFormResponse`.
  - <a>Broker</a> presents the contents of the `OrderQuote` to the `Customer` to ensure they have the most up-to-date price and availability before proceeding with the purchase.
  - If there are any issues with the `OrderItem`s requested in the `OrderQuote`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `409 Conflict` response, with `error` details provided against each offending `OrderItem` - including if an `OrderItem` is no longer available, cannot be purchased in combination with another `OrderItem`, or does not contain a sufficient `orderItemIntakeFormResponse`.
  - Any `error`s must be resolved by the <a>Customer</a> or <a>Broker</a> before proceeding, by amending the `OrderItem`s included in the `OrderQuote` and resubmitting until an `OrderQuote` is returned without `error`s.


v) "**3. Book and Pay**" - User enters payment details and clicks Book

  - The <a>Customer</a> MUST only be allowed to proceed if no `OrderItem`s in the `OrderQuote` contain any `error`s.

  - If `prepayment` of the selected `Offer` is `https://openactive.io/Optional` the <a>Customer</a> MAY be given the option to prepay or simply reserve a space without payment. Providing optionality of payment to the <a>Customer</a> is at the <a>Broker</a>'s discretion.

  - If `totalPaymentDue` is `0` due to all `OrderItem`s being free of charge, `prepayment` of the selected `Offer` is `https://openactive.io/Unavailable`, or `prepayment` is `https://openactive.io/Optional` and the <a>Customer</a> has chosen not to pay, payment details MUST NOT be captured.


vi) **Payment Authorisation** - <a>Broker</a> pre-authorises `totalPaymentDue` from <a>Payment Provider</a>

  - `Order` `id` (which includes the UUID) SHOULD be used as a reference in the <a>Payment Provider</a>, if possible.

  - If payment details were not captured due to the `prepayment` value of the selected `Offer` or `totalPaymentDue` equalling `0`, pre-authorisation MUST NOT be taken.

  - The <a>Broker</a> MUST store the `Order` request with an `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized` at this point, even if pre-authorisation is not taken, in order to ensure that the UUID in the <a>Orders feed</a> is recognised without a race condition.

  - The creation of the initial `Order` in the <a>Broker</a>'s store at this stage MUST be completed before the next step begins to prevent the unlikely race condition of an `Order` that is created at **B** and then immediately cancelled by the <a>Booking System</a>, which could result in the <a>Broker</a> receiving an unrecognised `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a> if it was retrieved before the call to **B** returned.

vii) **Order Creation / B**  - <a>Broker</a> call with `Order` including UUID with a `customer` object and any `orderItemIntakeFormResponse` required, and `totalPaymentDue` including the total amount pre-authed, <a>Booking System</a> responds with an `Order`.

  - If payment details were not captured due to the `prepayment` value of the selected `Offer`, or if `totalPaymentDue` is `0` due to all `OrderItem`s being free of charge,  the `payment` property MUST NOT be included in the `Order` request or response. If `payment` is are omitted where `totalPaymentDue` is not `0`, and `prepayment` in the `Offer` is `https://openactive.io/Required` or unspecified, then a `IncompletePaymentDetailsError` MUST be returned.

  - The `identifier` of the `Payment` is taken from the payment pre-authorization, which must be reconciled with the 

  - If the `totalPaymentDue` included in the `Order` object is different to the current `totalPaymentDue` (which might have changed since **C2**, e.g. if the headline price is changed in the <a>Booking System</a> between these two steps), the booking fails but the lease is sustained so that the user can be prompted whether they want to continue with the new amount.

  - If the lease has expired, or if leases are not supported, then the <a>Booking System</a> attempts to make the booking anyway. If there are insufficient spaces available for `OrderItem`s the booking fails.

  - If the booking succeeds only for some `OrderItem`s, the whole transaction is rolled back and the entire booking fails.

  - If there's a network failure, e.g. no response from server, then <a>Broker</a> can resubmit with same UUID. As the call is idempotent, the <a>Booking System</a> will need to track the UUID supplied by <a>Broker</a> against any successful orders, to ensure that it can return the same `Order` for subsequent requests. <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT reuse UUIDs across multiple `Order`s.

  - If the call is successful (returns a 200 response), the booking is considered as complete and paid by the <a>Booking System</a> at this point.

  - The <a>Booking System</a> MUST reflect back all properties defined by this specification that are supplied by the <a>Broker</a>'s request in the `Order` returned from this call, including `broker` and `brokerRole`, to acknowledge they have been recognised (even if they have not actually been stored by the <a>Booking System</a>). The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT reflect back extension properties outside of this specification unless it explicitly supports them.

  - The `Order` returned from this call MUST be stored by the <a>Broker</a>, to be subsequently updated by the <a>Orders feed</a>. The <a>Orders feed</a> contains only partial-updates of the `Order` stored by the <a>Broker</a>, and the <a>Broker</a> is the only actor guaranteed to maintain a complete view of the `Order`. The <a>Booking System</a> MAY store the full `Order` if desired.

  - It is the responsibility of the <a>Broker</a> to store any additional state it requires that is not included in the `Order` returned from this call, and RECOMMENDED that such state is stored alongside the <a>Broker</a>'s persisted `Order`.

  - The <a>Broker</a> MUST store the `Order` response in with an `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentDue` at this point (or `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured` if no payment is due).

  - This call is idempotent, and hence if the UUID used for an `Order` already represents a completed Order with the same set of `OrderItem`s for the same `customer` as those specified, the success response is returned as normal. If any differences exist in the `Order`s, a UUID clash is assumed, a 500 response of with `OrderAlreadyExistsError` is returned by the <a>Booking System</a>, and a new UUID must be generated by the <a>Broker</a> to retry the call.

  - As this call is idempotent, it can be safely retried in the case of an temporary unexpected error (any error that returns status code 503) or rate limiting (any error that returns status code 429).

  - When the request still returns status code 503 after a number of retries the UUID MUST be regenerated to allow for a clean retry of the booking. UUID MUST NOT be regenerated for expected errors (status code 4xx).

viii) **Payment Capture** - <a>Broker</a> captures `totalPaymentDue` from <a>Payment Provider</a>

  - It is the <a>Broker</a>'s responsibility to ensure that payment has been captured.

  - The <a>Broker</a> MUST update its stored `Order` with an `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured` after payment is successfully captured.

 -  If payment details were not captured due to the `prepayment` value of the selected `Offer` or `totalPaymentDue` equalling `0`, payment MUST NOT be captured.

ix) **Invoice Generation** and **Customer Notification** - Upon successful **Payment Capture** (or completing **B** in the case of payment capture not being required), the <a>Broker</a> generates invoices, sends <a>Customer</a> notifications, and stores the `Order` in a success state based on the response from **B**.

 - The <a>Broker</a> MUST update its stored `Order` in with an `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderDelivered` after invoices have been created and notifications successfully sent.

x) **Refunds and Cancellation** - The <a>Broker</a> subscribes to updates from the <a>Booking System</a> to process cancellations and refunds.
  - A secure <a>Orders feed</a> of `Order`s MUST be provided by the <a>Booking System</a>, with the contents of the feed specific to the authentication credentials. This allows the <a>Broker</a> to maintain an updated state of all their bookings across a number of <a>Booking Systems</a>, even when changes are made outside of the <a>Broker</a>. This also allows the <a>Broker</a> to handle refunds for cancellations, and process notifications to <a>Customers</a> in a consistent way.
  - The <a>Booking System</a> must ensure that the `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> represent the current state of `OrderItem`s within the system, for the properties included in the feed. The <a>Broker</a> MUST use these `Order`s to process refunds and send update notifications to the <a>Customer</a>.


### Booking Flow Rollback

To ensure catastrophic errors are detected and resolved the <a>Broker</a> MUST periodically check its own store for any `Orders` that have not been updated in over a 2 minutes, and have an `orderCreationStatus` other than `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete`.

Note that due to the ordering of the Booking Flow, no notifications will have been sent to the <a>Customer</a>, so no notifications regarding the rollback are required assuming it is performed promptly.

#### Booking halted at OrderCreationPaymentCaptured

If the `orderCreationStatus` is `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured`, **Invoice Generation** and **Customer Notification** should simply be retried, and the `orderCreationStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete` on success with no further rollback steps taken.

#### Booking halted at OrderCreationPaymentDue

If an error occurs during **Payment Capture**, which is very unlikely but possible due to system failure, and detectable where the `orderCreationStatus` is `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentDue`, the <a>Broker</a> MUST either:
  - Initiate manual capture via e.g. the <a>Payment Provider</a>'s admin console. Note the pre-auth will typically last for 7 days, so manual capture is still possible after the event.
  - Capture the payment from the user manually.
  - Absorb the loss and make a new payment for the same amount with the same UUID in the <a>Payment Provider</a> (better for UX / customer service, if manual capture not possible).
  - Acknowledge that payment cannot be successfully captured.

After payment has been successfully captured via one of the above methods, the `orderCreationStatus` MUST be set to `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured`, which will cause **Invoice Generation** and **Customer Notification** to be retried as per the previous section.

If the payment cannot be captured successfully:
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST issue a Order Deletion (DELETE) request for the `Order` to remove it from the <a>Booking System</a>.
- The `orderCreationStatus` MUST be set to `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized`, to trigger the rollback step in the next section. 

#### Booking halted at OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized

If the `orderCreationStatus` is `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized`, the <a>Broker</a> MUST:
- Cancel the associated Payment Authorisation from the <a>Payment Provider</a>.
- Soft delete the contents of the `Order` from the <a>Broker</a> (deleting any personal data, while retaining data required for audit), retaining the UUID.

Note that the UUID is retained so that any related entries in the <a>Orders Feed</a> can be appropriately assigned and ignored.


### Broker contract

A summary of the key conformance criteria is included here.

#### Broker contract with Booking System

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call **C1** (without <a>Customer</a> details)
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call **C2** (with <a>Customer</a> details), to retrieve the total order, providing all required details and resulting in no errors before calling **B**.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call **B** (with payment identifier if relevant), and MUST store the resulting `Order`.
- If **B** fails, the <a>Broker</a> MUST cancel the payment authorisation without any consequence to the <a>Customer</a> or <a>Seller</a>.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST process all updates to the `Order` from the <a>Orders feed</a>, specifically monitoring the <a>Orders Feed</a> for cancellations.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST generate a UUID, and use it consistently during the booking flow.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT reuse UUID across complete or incomplete `Order`s.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST make the <a>Customer</a> aware of any relevant `termsOfService`, for example by displaying a link to them prominently, before they commit to the booking.
- If `requiresExplicitConsent` is `true` for any `termsOfService` then the <a>Customer</a> MUST only be allowed to proceed if they have explicitly acted to assent to such terms.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST handle payments and reconciliation with the <a>Seller</a> and the <a>Payment Provider</a>.

#### Booking System contract with the Broker

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to **C1** (without <a>Customer</a> details) with an `OrderQuote` that includes an indicative total order price, or a relevant error. It must also include the specification of any additional details to captured from the <a>Customer</a> to be provided to **C2**.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to **C2** (with <a>Customer</a> details) with an `OrderQuote` that includes an exact total order price, or a relevant error. It must also produce a relevant error if the additional details specified are not sufficient.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to **B** with a completed `Order`, or a relevant error. The whole booking MUST succeed or fails as one.
- Upon any cancellations or updates to the `Order` or any `OrderItem` within it, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the updated `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a>.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST store UUID as part of the `Order` (and `OrderQuote` if leasing is enabled).
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST refuse attempts to create new orders with a previously used UUID.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST check availability and confirm pricing during **C1**, **C2**, and **B** to ensure booking can complete.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST provide an authenticated Orders Feed specific to the Broker.
Include sufficient pricing & avail data in opportunity feeds.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST provide [[RPDE]] open feeds of <a>Opportunities</a>.

Calls to **C1**, **C2**, and **B** MUST be idempotent, based on the UUID.

With the exception of leasing, **C1** and **C2** MUST NOT have any side effects.


## Booking Flow with Approval

The <a>Booking System</a> MAY optionally support approval of bookings by the <a>Seller</a>. As the approval processes is initiated by the <a>Booking System</a>, implementation of this section by the <a>Booking System</a> is only required if this flow is supported, otherwise this section can be completely ignored.

### Customer Journey
The booking journey of a <a>Customer</a> is generalised into the following logical steps:

<figure>
 <img src="userjourneywithapproval.png" alt="High level user journey with approval">
 <figcaption>Illustration of a typical <a>Customer</a> journey, with an approval step.</figcaption>
</figure>

The steps exactly mirror the Simple Booking Flow, with two additions:

1. **Select**: <a>Customer</a> selects at least one <a>Opportunity</a> (e.g. `ScheduledSession` or `Slot`) and an associated `Offer` ("Junior (8-18) Â£9")
2. **Identify**: <a>Customer</a> submits personal details and other requested details
   1. **Propose**: <a>Customer</a> submits payment details, and submits a proposed booking
   2. **Approve**: <a>Seller</a> approves the booking, after a period of time
3. **Book and Pay**: <a>Customer</a> confirms they are happy to proceed

Note that some or all steps may be skipped, or may not be presented to the user, e.g. if their registration or payment details are already known, or they are using a voice interface. These steps are not indicative of the user experience, and simply provide a common language around the flow.

### High-level API flow

<figure>
 <img src="bookingflowwithapproval.png" alt="High level booking flow with approval">
 <figcaption>Illustration of high level booking flow, including approval.</figcaption>
</figure>

The flow exactly mirrors the Simple Booking Flow, with two additions:

- The <a>Broker</a> generates a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) which is used to uniquely identify the `Order` throughout the process.

- After "**1. Select**" the <a>Broker</a> calls the <a>Booking System</a> to confirm an indicative price and availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, and retrieve a total order price. Any details that the <a>Customer</a> needs to supply to complete the booking are also specified. This is checkpoint **C1** on the diagram above.

- After "**2. Identify**" the <a>Broker</a> calls the <a>Booking System</a> to reconfirm the price and availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, using all details required, and retrieve a total order price. Explicit consent for any terms and conditions is also captured at this stage if required. This is checkpoint **C2** on the diagram above.

- After "**2.1. Propose**", the <a>Broker</a> first _pre-authorizes_ the payment for the total order price (if required by the <a>Payment Provider</a>), then submits the proposed booking to the <a>Booking System</a> using an `OrderProposal` (**P** on the diagram above), and sends the <a>Customer</a> a notification that the proposal is under consideration. The `OrderProposal` may be negotiated between the <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a> via the <a>Broker</a> at this stage.

- After "**2.2. Approve**" the <a>Seller</a> approves the `OrderProposal` and the <a>Broker</a> is notified of this by the <a>Booking System</a> (**A** on the diagram above). The <a>Broker</a> can seek <a>Customer</a> permission to proceed, or simply complete the booking automatically, depending on the desired user experience.

- After "**3. Book and Pay**", if necessary the <a>Broker</a> _re-authorizes_ the payment for the total order price (if it has changed, and if required by the <a>Payment Provider</a>), then confirms the booking with <a>Booking System</a> using an `Order` (**B** on the diagram above), and finally _captures_ the payment. The <a>Broker</a> then generates invoices, and sends <a>Customer</a> notifications.

- The <a>Booking System</a> adds the `Order` to an <a>Orders feed</a> specific to the <a>Broker</a>, which the <a>Broker</a> reads to update its internal state, including those updates resulting from cancellations.

Note that the `OrderProposal` at stages 2.1 and 2.2 does not constitute a booking. The whole flow MUST be completed before the <a>Customer</a> is considered "booked" onto an <a>Opportunity</a>.

### Leasing

Leasing works as specified in the Simple Booking Flow, and if a lease was acquired at **C1** or **C2** it SHOULD be carried over to the `OrderProposal` and the lease extended for a duration sufficient to cover the lifetime of the `OrderProposal`.

A lease is NOT REQUIRED for this flow, as in some cases <a>Sellers</a> may prefer to manage contention for spaces manually via the approval process instead of leasing.

If an `OrderProposal` remains in a `orderProposalStatus` other than `https://openactive.io/CustomerRejected` or `https://openactive.io/SellerRejected` after the lease has expired, it MUST be possible for the <a>Customer</a> to still complete the booking if they attain approval. For example, if an <a>Opportunity</a> becomes full and no substitute opportunities are available, then all remaining outstanding `OrderProposal`s related to that <a>Opportunity</a> would need to be automatically rejected.

If the lease expires the <a>Booking System</a> could, for example, automatically reject the `OrderProposal` on behalf of the `Seller`, automatically renew the lease, or allow the <a>Seller</a> to manually deal with the contention for spaces as part of the approval process and hence do nothing.


### High-level type flow

<figure>
 <img src="typeflowwithapproval.png" alt="High level type flow with approval">
 <figcaption>Illustration of types used during the API flow, with approval.</figcaption>
</figure>

As specified in the Simple Booking Flow, with one addition:

- **P/A** - `OrderProposal` exists in a number of states, as described in the next section, and contains enough detail to successfully create an `Order`.

### OrderProposal statuses

<figure>
 <img src="order-proposal-states.png" alt="OrderProposal states">
 <figcaption>State transition diagram showing OrderProposal states</figcaption>
</figure>

`OrderProposal` has an `orderProposalStatus` which is initially set by the <a>Booking System</a> to `https://openactive.io/AwaitingSellerConfirmation`.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST only proceed to **B** when `orderProposalStatus` is set to `https://openactive.io/SellerAccepted` in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

An `OrderProposal` MUST be approved or rejected atomically; partial approval is not supported in this version of the specification (though **Proposal Amendment** is supported).

To reach the criteria to proceed to **B**, or rejection, `OrderProposal` MUST be transitioned through states as follows:
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST transition the `OrderProposal` to a new `orderProposalStatus` by updating the <a>Orders feed</a>.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST transition the `OrderProposal` to a new `orderProposalStatus` by submitting a PATCH to the `OrderProposal` using the OrderProposal Update endpoint.

#### Minimal Implementation

In the **Minimal Implementation** the `OrderProposal` can either be accepted or rejected by the <a>Seller</a>, or aborted by the <a>Customer</a>.

If an `Offer` requires this **Minimal Implementation**, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingApproval` in the `Offer`s within its open data. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support approval to easily filter out such offers from their experience.

Note that when `Offer`s that require approval are mixed with `Offer`s that do not require approval in a single `OrderQuote`, the whole `OrderQuote` MUST always require approval. It is at the discretion of the <a>Broker</a> whether to issue two separate `OrderQuote`s (and hence complete two separate booking flows) that batch those `OrderItem`s that require approval separately to those that do not, or whether to instead combine them together into a single `OrderQuote` and hence complete a single booking flow with approval.


##### Proposal Approval

- If <a>Seller</a> approval is given, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST set `orderProposalStatus` to `https://openactive.io/SellerAccepted` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, which will give the <a>Broker</a> permission to proceed to **B**.
- For the **Minimal Implementation**, the <a>Broker</a> must check that the `orderProposalVersion` received in the <a>Orders Feed</a> matches the original `orderProposalVersion` returned at **P**. If this is the case the <a>Broker</a> may seek <a>Customer</a> confirmation to proceed, or may simply proceed with **B** automatically, depending on the desired user experience. If this is not the case, the scenario MUST be handled via the **Proposal Amendment** process.

##### Proposal Rejection

- If the <a>Seller</a> rejects the proposal, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST set `orderProposalStatus` to `https://openactive.io/SellerRejected` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, optionally including an `orderSellerNote` containing any reason for rejection.
- If the <a>Customer</a> aborts the proposal, the <a>Broker</a> MUST PATCH the `OrderProposal` to set the `orderProposalStatus` to `https://openactive.io/CustomerRejected`, optionally including an `orderCustomerNote` containing any associated reason. The <a>Booking System</a> will then update this in the <a>Orders feed</a>,

Following any type of rejection, the <a>Broker</a> MUST immediately withdraw any payment authorisation.

#### Proposal Amendment

The <a>Booking System</a> MAY optionally support **Proposal Amendment**. If this is not supported by the <a>Booking System</a>, the simple Approval/Rejection workflow described in the **Minimal Implementation** may be used without needing to consider this (as the amendments are initiated by the <a>Booking System</a>).

If an `Offer` may require **Proposal Amendment**, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingNegotiation` in the `Offer`s within its open data. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support such negotiation to easily filter out such offers from their experience.

**Proposal Amendment** allows the <a>Seller</a> to suggest amendments to the `OrderProposal` (which need to be accepted by the <a>Customer</a>) as follows:

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST make the `OrderProposal` available in the <a>Orders feed</a>, with `orderProposalStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/SellerAccepted`, `orderProposalVersion` set to a new generated value, and optionally including an `orderSellerNote` containing reasons for any amendments.
- If the `orderProposalVersion` in the <a>Orders feed</a> has changed compared with the `orderProposalVersion` in the `OrderProposal` stored by the <a>Broker</a>, the <a>Broker</a> MUST notify the <a>Customer</a> that their booking requires confirmation before it can proceed. The <a>Broker</a> MUST detect and highlight any changes from their stored `OrderProposal` in the notification, based on the difference between the `OrderItem`s stored by the <a>Broker</a> and those in the feed.
- When the <a>Customer</a> confirms, the <a>Broker</a> MUST re-authorise the `totalPaymentDue`, if it has increased, with the <a>Payment Provider</a>, then proceed to **B** using the `orderProposalVersion` the <a>Customer</a> has agreed to.
- The <a>Customer</a> or <a>Seller</a> MAY also choose to abort at any point as per **Minimal Implementation**.

Note that this specification does not support `OrderProposal` amendment by the <a>Customer</a>, and that <a>Customer</a> requests for changes to an existing proposal may be done via messages communicated via **Message Exchange**.


#### Message Exchange

The <a>Booking System</a> and <a>Broker</a> MUST support a basic level of **Message Exchange** while the `OrderProposal` is in-flight. 

**Message Exchange** is achieved using the two properties `orderSellerNote` and `orderCustomerNote`, and does not have any impact on the `orderProposalVersion`.

The <a>Seller</a> MAY send a message to the <a>Customer</a> by setting `orderSellerNote` in the `OrderProposal`, and updating the `OrderProposal` in the <a>Orders feed</a>. Any change detected in the `orderSellerNote` in the <a>Orders feed</a> MUST promptly trigger a notification from the <a>Broker</a> to the <a>Customer</a>, so that the value of `orderSellerNote` can be safely overwritten with another message. To ensure that messages are not lost in the RPDE feed, the <a>Seller</a> MAY send no more than one message every 5 minutes per `OrderProposal`.

The <a>Customer</a> MAY send a message to the <a>Seller</a> by the <a>Broker</a> making a PATCH call to the OrderProposal Update endpoint to set `orderCustomerNote` in the `OrderProposal` e.g. `{"orderCustomerNote": "If you let me attend for free this time, you're on!" }`. Any such `orderCustomerNote` updates via PATCH calls MUST either trigger a notification from the <a>Booking System</a> to the <a>Seller</a>, or be stored in the <a>Booking System</a> for later reference by the <a>Seller</a>, so that the value of `orderCustomerNote` can be safely overwritten with another message.

Note that the `orderCustomerNote` property MUST NOT be available in the <a>Orders feed</a>, to remove unnecessary RPDE updates.


### Step-by-step process description

<figure>
 <img src="sequencediagramwithapproval.png" alt="Sequence diagram with approval">
 <figcaption>Sequence diagram showing API interactions with approval</figcaption>
</figure>

For an `Order` that requires approval, the flow differs from the above as follows:

- `OrderQuote` is returned at **C1** and **C2** with `orderRequiresApproval` set to `true` if any `OrderItem`s require approval.
- `OrderItem`s that require approval within an `OrderProposal` have `orderItemStatus` of either `https://openactive.io/OrderApprovalPending` or `https://openactive.io/OrderApprovalAutomatic`, to indicate which specific items are contingent on approval and which could be purchased separately.
- The `OrderProposal` MAY include an `orderCustomerNote` in order to "Ask a question about this opportunity?".
- Additional data is supplied at **C1** and **C2** as in the Simple Booking Flow to satisfy the `orderItemIntakeForm` for all `OrderItems`.
- The `totalPaymentDue` from **C2** is used for Payment Authorisation as with the Simple Booking Flow.
- An additional step **P** is required after **C2** where the <a>Broker</a> submits the completed `OrderProposal` to the <a>Booking System</a>, which returns an `OrderProposal` that the <a>Broker</a> MUST store, with `orderProposalStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/AwaitingSellerConfirmation`. The call is atomic. The returned `OrderProposal` also contains an `orderProposalVersion` (constructed from the `id` of the `OrderProposal` combined an additional version UUID, e.g. `https://api.example.com/order-proposals/358105b4-e571-43fa-b737-906d319c6a32/version/8eb1a6ce-3f5b-40b0-87a7-bddb4c5518bd`). Note that as with **B**, the `OrderProposal` from **P** will not be present in the <a>Orders feed</a> until it is updated at least once.
- Once approved, the <a>Booking System</a> puts the updated `OrderProposal` onto the <a>Orders feed</a> (**A**), with either an unchanged `orderProposalVersion` (see **Minimal Implementation**) or a new `orderProposalVersion` (see **Proposal Amendment**).
- If required due to expiration of the existing Payment Authorisation or a change in the `totalPaymentDue`, the payment can be re-authorised before **B**. 
- The <a>Broker</a> supplies a minimal `Order` to **B** that just contains this `orderProposalVersion`, and continues the flow as per the Simple Booking Flow.


### Broker contract

A summary of the key conformance criteria is included here. These apply for the Booking Flow with Approval in addition to the contract specified in the Simple Booking Flow.

#### Broker contract with Booking System

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call **P** with <a>Customer</a> details as they would for **B** in the Simple Booking Flow, and MUST store the resulting `OrderProposal`.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST process updates to the `OrderProposal` from the <a>Orders feed</a>, including **A**.
- The <a>Broker</a> MAY negotiate on the `OrderProposal` using a OrderProposal Update call.

#### Booking System contract with the Broker

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to **P** with an `OrderProposal`, or a relevant error. The whole creation of the `OrderProposal` MUST succeed or fails as one.
- Upon approval or updates to the `OrderProposal` or any `OrderItem` within it, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the updated `OrderProposal` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, including **A**.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MAY negotiate on the `OrderProposal` using the <a>Orders feed</a>.

Calls to **P** MUST be idempotent, based on the UUID.


## Customer Details and Additional Details capture

### Customer Details

The specification includes provision to capture of the following details related to the <a>Customer</a> (the actor who is booking), with only the e-mail address being required.
- E-mail address (`email`)
- Forename (`givenName`)
- Surname (`familyName`)
- Telephone (`telephone`)

Note that these are _not_ the details of attendees, and that the <a>Customer</a> is not guaranteed to participate in the activity.

### Attendee Details

If attendee details in scope of the `Person` type are captured, they MUST be captured via the `attendee` property of the `OrderItem` (and not using the `orderItemIntakeForm`). This allows attendee details to be stored and reused by the <a>Broker</a>.

Note that conformance with this specification requires that the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT _require_ attendee data to be submitted in all cases, and that configuration of which attendee details are required (if any) MUST be available to the <a>Seller</a>.

If an `Offer` requires attendee details capture, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingAttendeeDetails` in the `Offer`s within its open data. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support attendee details capture to easily filter out such offers from their experience.

<pre class="example" title="Example of attendeeDetailsRequired provided by Booking System at C1">
  {
    "type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "attendeeDetailsRequired": [
      "https://schema.org/givenName",
      "https://schema.org/familyName"
    ],
  }
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Example of attendee details provided with each OrderItem at C2">
  {
    "type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "attendee": {
      "type": "Person",
      "email": "geoffcapes@example.com",
      "telephone": "020 811 8055",
      "givenName": "Geoff",
      "familyName": "Capes"
    }
  }
</pre>

If a required property within `Person` is not supplied by the <a>Broker</a> the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include an `IncompleteAttendeeDetailsError` against the offending `OrderItem` at **C2** which includes an `instance` that references the `id` of the missing or invalid `Property`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of an error for missing attendee property data">
  {
    "type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "error": [
      {
        "type": "IncompleteAttendeeDetailsError",
        "instance": "https://schema.org/givenName",
        "description": "Missing attendee first name"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

The <a>Broker</a> MAY remember the attendee data previously submitted by the <a>Customer</a>, if consent is provided.


### Additional Details

This version of the specification does not provide details to construct a complex additional details capture form, however it does facilitate simple text fields to capture additional details. These can be used for both the Simple Booking Flow and the Booking Flow with Approval.

If an `Offer` requires additional details capture, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingIntakeForm` in the `Offer`s within its open data. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support additional details capture to easily filter out such offers from their experience.

<pre class="example" title="Example of orderItemIntakeForm provided by Booking System at C1">
  {
    "type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "orderItemIntakeForm": [
      {
        "type": "PropertyValueSpecification",
        "id": "https://example.com/experience",
        "name": "More information about you",
        "description": "Have you played before? Are you a complete beginner or seasoned pro?",
        "valueRequired": true
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Example of orderItemIntakeFormResponse provided by Broker at C2">
  {
    "type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "orderItemIntakeFormResponse": [
      {
        "type": "PropertyValue",
        "propertyID": "https://example.com/experience",
        "value": "I've played twice before, but I'm a quick learner so I hope to keep up!"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

If a field with `valueRequired` is not supplied by the <a>Broker</a> the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include an `IncompleteIntakeFormError` against the offending `OrderItem` at **C2** which includes an `instance` that references the `id` of the `PropertyValueSpecification`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of an error for missing additional details field data">
  {
    "type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "error": [
      {
        "type": "IncompleteIntakeFormError",
        "instance": "https://example.com/experience",
        "description": "Incomplete additional details supplied"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

The <a>Broker</a> MAY remember the values previously submitted by the <a>Customer</a> based on the `id` of the `PropertyValueSpecification`, if consent is provided.

It is expected that future versions of the specification will support more complex field types.

# Broker Roles

A <a>Broker</a> is an actor that arranges transactions between a <a>Seller</a> and <a>Customer</a>, either directly or indirectly.

From a contractual and taxation perspective, there are two types of <a>Broker</a>, and agent (`AgentBroker`), and a reseller (`ResellerBroker`), as well direct purchase (`NoBroker`).

Note that this specification does not deal with contractual relationships, and simply provides a mechanism to record bookings.

## `ResellerBroker`

### Definition
A reseller is a company or individual that purchases goods or services with the intention of selling them rather than consuming or using them. This is usually done for profit (but could be resold at a loss).

### Contractual Relationships
In the context of OpenActive, a `ResellerBroker` contracts directly with the <a>Seller</a> as a business-to-business relationship to purchase access to the opportunity. It then, at a later point in time (which may only be milliseconds later), separately forms a contractual relationship with the <a>Customer</a>, who purchases access to the opportunity from the `ResellerBroker`.

<figure>
 <img src="ResellerBroker.png" alt="ResellerBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in ResellerBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>


### Taxation
The `ResellerBroker`'s purchase from the <a>Seller</a> is business-to-business, which is subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `ResellerBroker` as the <a>Customer</a>.
The <a>Customer</a>'s purchase from the `ResellerBroker` is business-to-consumer, which is subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `ResellerBroker` as the <a>Seller</a>.

Hence any tax exemption that the <a>Customer</a> may enjoy when purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. in UK law, if the <a>Seller</a> is an [VAT exempt eligible body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sport-supplies-that-are-vat-exempt-notice-70145)) is not relevant here, as no direct contractual relationship is formed between <a>Seller</a> and <a>Customer</a>.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the interaction between the `ResellerBroker` and <a>Seller</a>. It does include provision for the interaction between the `ResellerBroker` and <a>Customer</a> explicitly, though it may be repurposed by the <a>Broker</a> to perform this function by treating the <a>Broker</a> as a <a>Booking System</a>. This specification also does not include provision for the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship with any <a>Payment Provider</a> (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships MUST be handled separately.
When the `brokerRole` is set to `ResellerBroker`, this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `broker` specified in the `Order`.
Note that the `customer` may still optionally be included in the Order, for example to help front-of-house staff identify the <a>Customer</a>.

### Conformance criteria
When the <a>Broker</a> generates the <a>Invoice</a>, it must be made payable to `Order.broker`, `Order.broker` MUST be provided and `Order.customer` is optional.


## `AgentBroker`

### Definition
An agent is authorized to act on behalf of another (the <a>Seller</a>, or "principle") to create legal relations with a third party (the <a>Customer</a>). Succinctly, it may be referred to as the equal relationship between a <a>Seller</a> and an agent whereby the principal, expressly or implicitly, authorizes the agent to work under his or her control and on his or her behalf. The agent is required to negotiate on behalf of the principal (<a>Seller</a>) and/or bring them and third parties (<a>Customers</a>) into contractual relationship.

### Contractual Relationships
There are three separate types of contractual relationship involved:
`AgentBroker` with <a>Seller</a>, known as the principal-agent relationship or "internal" relationship;
`AgentBroker` with <a>Customer</a> with whom they deal on their <a>Seller</a>'s behalf ("external relationship"); and
<a>Seller</a> with <a>Customer</a> when arranged by an `AgentBroker`.

<figure>
 <img src="AgentBroker.png" alt="AgentBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in AgentBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>

### Taxation
While facilitated by the `AgentBroker`, the primary purchase is made by the <a>Customer</a> directly from the <a>Seller</a>, as would be the case if the <a>Customer</a> was to purchase from the <a>Seller</a> independently.
Hence any tax exemption that the <a>Customer</a> may enjoy when purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. in UK law, if the <a>Seller</a> is an [VAT exempt eligible body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sport-supplies-that-are-vat-exempt-notice-70145)) is relevant here.

The <a>Customer</a>'s relationship with `AgentBroker` is business-to-consumer. Hence any additional services (e.g. customer-facing booking fees) are subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `AgentBroker` as the `seller`.

The `AgentBroker`'s relationship with the <a>Seller</a> is business-to-business. Hence any additional services (e.g. booking commission) are subject to the appropriate taxation.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship between the <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a>.
The scope of this specification does not include the contractual relationship between the `AgentBroker` and the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. for booking commission), between the `AgentBroker` and the <a>Customer</a> (e.g. for booking fees) or with any <a>Payment Provider</a> (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships and the reconciliation of associated invoices MUST be handled separately.
When the `brokerRole` is set to `AgentBroker`, this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `customer` specified in the `Order`.

### Conformance criteria
When the <a>Broker</a> generates the <a>Invoice</a>, it must be made payable to `Order.customer`, `Order.broker` MUST be provided and `Order.customer` MUST be provided.

### Informed purchase
When using a `brokerRole` of `AgentBroker`, the <a>Broker</a> MUST make the <a>Customer</a> aware that they are purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> via the <a>Broker</a>, and not directly from the <a>Broker</a>.

## `NoBroker`

### Definition
This specification supports direct purchase by a <a>Customer</a> (for example in the context of the <a>Seller</a>'s own website, or for businesses that purchase large volumes of FacilityUse slots to run leagues).

### Contractual Relationships
The contractual relationship is a simple one between the <a>Seller</a> and the <a>Customer</a>.

<figure>
 <img src="NoBroker.png" alt="NoBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in NoBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>

### Taxation
The purchase is made by the <a>Customer</a> directly from the <a>Seller</a>, as would be the case if the <a>Customer</a> was to purchase from the <a>Seller</a> outside of this specification.
Hence any tax exemption that the <a>Customer</a> may enjoy when purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. in UK law, if the <a>Seller</a> is an VAT exempt eligible body) is relevant here.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship between the <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a>.
The scope of this specification does not include the contractual relationship with any <a>Payment Provider</a> (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships MUST be handled separately.

When the `brokerRole` is set to `NoBroker`, this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `customer` specified in the `Order`.

### Conformance criteria
When an <a>Invoice</a> is generated, it must be made payable to `Order.customer`, `Order.broker` MUST NOT be provided and `Order.customer` MUST be provided.

# Systems of Record


## Roles and responsibilities overview


For the purposes of this specification, the key components of a booking are: `Order`, <a>Invoice</a>, <a>Payment</a> and <a>Refund</a>.

Note that `OrderQuote` is a subclass of `Order` used during the `Order` creation process, and is not explicitly persisted.

The <a>Broker</a> has visibility of all components, while for simplicity of implementation the <a>Booking System</a> only has visibility of the `Order`, as shown below:

<figure>
 <img src="roles.png" alt="Roles and responsibilities">
 <figcaption>Roles and responsibilities</figcaption>
</figure>

`Order`s are the basis of the exchange between the <a>Booking System</a> and the <a>Broker</a>, with `OrderQuote`s used as part of the `Order` creation process. This specification describes a detailed model and API to allow <a>Brokers</a> to manipulate `Order`s, and only high level functional requirements for the expected behaviour of <a>Invoices</a>, <a>Payments</a>, and <a>Refunds</a>.


| Component | Description | Owner | Audit |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| <dfn>`Order`</dfn> | A mutable object that encompasses the live state of the bookable `Event`s within the <a>Booking System</a>. An `Order` has a `orderItem`s, a `totalPaymentDue`, and all tax details, but is not itself a legal representation of a purchase from the <a>Seller</a>. | <a>Booking System</a>. | Mutable |
| <dfn>Invoice</dfn> | An immutable object that is a legal representation of the purchase, which MUST be rendered to the <a>Customer</a> as a legally permissible tax receipt, and exist as a tax point. A new <a>Invoice</a> MUST be generated for the `Order` to replace the previous <a>Invoice</a> each occasion that an `orderItem` within an `Order` is cancelled. | <a>Broker</a> | Immutable |
| <dfn>Payment</dfn> | A immutable object that represents the original payment to the <a>Seller</a> for the initial `Order`. Although modelling the <a>Payment</a> is outside the scope of this specification, it is recommended that one payment exists for each `Order`. | <a>Payment Provider</a> | Immutable |
| <dfn>Refund</dfn> | An immutable object that represents each refund made against the <a>Payment</a>, up to the <a>Payment</a>'s total amount | <a>Payment Provider</a> | Immutable |


## Invoices and Tax receipts

Due to the variety of business models in use in OpenActive, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT send receipts directly to the <a>Customer</a> for `AgentBroker` and `ResellerBroker` bookings.

For each successful `Order` operation (where **C1**, **C2** and **B** together constitute a successful Order Creation operation), the <a>Broker</a> MUST generate a new <a>Invoice</a> in the form of a tax receipt, on the basis of the <a>Orders feed</a> contents. To ensure that the <a>Customer</a> is provided with the correct tax receipt, if `totalPaymentTaxSpecification` is provided in an `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, the <a>Broker</a> MUST generate a new or updated <a>Invoice</a> and either (a) send a tax receipt representation of the <a>Invoice</a> to the <a>Customer</a> and/or (b) offer a means to allow the <a>Customer</a> to easily retrieve a full tax receipt representation of the specific version of the  <a>Invoice</a> at any future date for any previous booking made. As it is ultimately the <a>Seller</a>'s responsibility to send tax receipts, they need to be confident that the <a>Broker</a> is making tax information available to its <a>Customers</a> in an accurate and timely manner.

The tax receipt sent by the <a>Broker</a> MUST comply with any legal requirements of the jurisdiction of operation.

Note by following specification, for all <a>Broker</a> modes where a <a>Seller</a> may need to supply a tax receipt manually for any reason, the <a>Seller</a> will have the details of the <a>Customer</a> and the transaction enough to generate the most recent tax receipt.


## Payments and Refunds

Although the details of <a>Payments</a> and <a>Refunds</a> are not in the scope of this specification, a single `Payment` object is included in the `Order` in the `payment` property to ensure payments are fully traceable in case of audit.

If payment details were not captured due to the `prepayment` value of the selected `Offer`, or if `totalPaymentDue` is `0` due to all `OrderItem`s being free of charge,  the `payment` property MUST NOT be included. In all other cases `payment` property MUST be included in the `Offer` at **B**.

### Virtual payments

Note that this `Payment` is permitted to represent a virtual <a>Payment</a> consolidating a number of actual **Payments** to allow for a wide variety of payment methods. In the case where the <a>Seller</a> is paid monthly, the <a>Payment</a> may also represent a reference to a future invoice against which the eventual <a>Payment</a> will be paid. 

### Basic `Payment`

A unique reference to this <a>Payment</a> MUST be included in the `Payment` `identifier` of the `Order` sent to the <a>Booking System</a>. This `Payment` `identifier` MUST be uniquely resolvable for audit purposes.

The `accountId` of the `Payment` SHOULD be provided to reference the specific account within the <a>Payment Provider</a> that is used for reconciliation purposes.

The `paymentProviderId` of the `Payment` SHOULD be provided to reference the specific <a>Payment Provider</a> that is used.

The `name` of the `Payment` SHOULD be used to provide information about the source of the payment that can be stored in the <a>Booking System</a>, to help the <a>Seller</a> in discussions with the <a>Customer</a> (e.g. "AcmeBroker Points" or "AcmeBroker via Credit Card").

<pre class="example" title="Example of Payment">
  "payment": {
    "type": "Payment",
    "identifier": "12345678ABCD",
    "name": "Big Media Services",
    "accountId": "SN1593",
    "paymentProviderId": "STRIPE"
  },
</pre>


### `DynamicPayment`

For fully dynamic pricing, where price is not known at the point of purchase, a `DynamicPayment` MUST be used. Example use cases include volume-based pricing, where the price of items are calculated at the end of the month depending on the total volume booked during that period.

To use the `DynamicPayment` the following preconditions must be met:
- The <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a> MUST have agreed an arrangement for dynamic pricing out-of-band, including which <a>Opportunities</a> and `Offer`s it applies to.
- Dynamic pricing cannot be mixed with standard pricing behaviour within the same `Order`, so all `OrderItem`s selected MUST be applicable for dynamic pricing based on such agreements.
- The <a>Opportunity</a> and `Offer` pairs that are selected for booking MUST be <a>bookable</a> as in the standard flow.
- If no appropriate `Offer` exists for a <a>bookable</a> <a>Opportunity</a>, an `OfferOverride` with price `0` MAY be used for **C1** and **C2**.

To use `DynamicPayment` the booking flow MUST be completed as normal with the following additional requirements:
- The booking flow MUST be completed as if `prepayment` was set to `https://openactive.io/Unavailable` for all `Offer`s.
- Behavior at **C1** and **C2** remains the same, to allow the <a>Broker</a> to record the original prices and tax implications if required.
- The `Order` submitted to **B** MUST have a `payment` property that contains a `DynamicPayment`.
- The `Order` submitted to **B**, returned from **B** and in the subsequent <a>Orders feed</a> MUST NOT include `totalPaymentDue` or `totalPaymentTaxSpecification`, and `OrderItem`s MUST NOT include `acceptedOffer` or `unitTaxSpecification`.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT record any price against the `Order` or `OrderItem`s for reconciliation, as such reconciliation MUST occur completely out-of-band.

The `accountId` of the `DynamicPayment` MUST be used consistently in order to allow the <a>Seller</a> to reconcile opportunities booked using a particular account.

The `name` of the `DynamicPayment` SHOULD be used to provide information about the source of the payment that can be stored in the <a>Booking System</a>,  to help the <a>Seller</a> in discussions with the <a>Customer</a> (e.g. "AcmeBroker Points" or "AcmeBroker Membership").

<pre class="example" title="Example of DynamicPayment">
  "payment": {
    "type": "DynamicPayment",
    "identifier": "12345678ABCD",
    "name": "MoveGB Membership",
    "accountId": "MOVE"
  },
</pre>

### Payment reconciliation

Although automated payment reconciliation is outside the current scope of this specification, a <a>Booking System</a> MAY include identifiers suitable for payment reconciliation to be handled out-of-band with each `OrderItem` using the `additionalProperty` property.

In keeping with the Schema.org definition of `PropertyValue`, the `name` and `value` properties MUST be provided within any given `PropertyValue`, and the <a>Broker</a> SHOULD include these in any reconciliation process with the <a>Seller</a>.

<pre class="example" title="Example of additionalProperty for OrderItem">
  "additionalProperty": [
    {
      "type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "SiteID",
      "value": "ABC1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "DeptID",
      "value": "D89"
    }
  ],
</pre>


### Integrated Payments

In some limited circumstances it might also be desirable for an Open Booking API to act as a facade over a <a>Booking System</a>, <a>Payment Provider</a>, and Invoicing systems. For these circumstances the specification allows the API defined here to be extended via additional OPTIONAL properties in the `Payment` type used in **B** in a custom namespace (as specified in the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification), to facilitate a full payment.

<pre class="example" title="Example of Payment extension point">
  "payment": {
    "type": "Payment",
    "identifier": "12345678ABCD",
    "paymentMethod": "stripe:StripePayment",
    "stripe:token": "tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf"
  },
</pre>

Note that due to the variety of business models available in the OpenActive ecosystem, conformance to this specification requires that the use of any native payment functionality in the <a>Booking System</a> be optional, and the <a>Booking System</a> MUST always accept a lack of `paymentMethod` as indication of an external <a>Payment Provider</a> being used. To maximise flexibility of this extension point, the `identifier` property within `Payment` is NOT REQUIRED if `paymentMethod` is specified.


## Tax calculation

### Business-to-consumer tax calculation by Booking System is mandatory

For `AgentBroker` and `NoBroker` modes, where the <a>Customer</a> is of type `Person` and a tax receipt is usually generated by the <a>Booking System</a>, the tax calculation and associated properties this specification MUST be implemented by the <a>Booking System</a> (even if the resulting tax amount is zero).

### Business-to-business tax calculation by Booking System is optional

Tax calculation at the <a>Booking System</a> is OPTIONAL when the `brokerRole` of `ResellerBroker` is specified, or when a <a>Customer</a> of type `Organization` is specified. If tax calculation is not supported for a `ResellerBroker`, `unitTaxSpecification` and `totalPaymentTaxSpecification` MUST NOT be included, and the `taxMode` `https://openactive/TaxNet` MUST be returned in the `OrderQuote` and `Order` (i.e. explicitly not including tax).

This allows tax to be calculated by the `ResellerBroker` or business <a>Customer</a> and reconciled outside of this specification.

Note that for business-to-business sales for a <a>Seller</a> with `taxMode` of the `organizer` or `provider` set to `https://openactive/TaxGross`, the `Offer`s available in the opportunity data will still be calculated as tax-inclusive for a business-to-consumer sale, and so MUST be presented by the <a>Broker</a> as such, with the business-to-business tax calculation occurring during the booking flow. If the usecase of presenting the correct price up-front gains traction, additional price data must be made available as part of the openly published opportunity data to resolve this shortcoming.

## Tax mode

The `taxMode` (`https://openactive/TaxNet` or `https://openactive/TaxGross`) is REQUIRED to be specified at the <a>Seller</a> level, and MUST be reflected within the `Organization` that is included in the REQUIRED `organizer` or `provider` properties within opportunity data specified in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]]. It MUST also be consistent for all `Order`s originating from that <a>Seller</a>.

Note that `taxMode` only effects the interpretation of the `price` of the `Offer`. `totalPaymentDue` is always Gross (tax inclusive), and `unitTaxSpecification` and `totalPaymentTaxSpecification` include only the taxes themselves so are uneffected.

| `taxMode`                                              | `https://openactive/TaxNet` | `https://openactive/TaxGross` |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Price displayed                                        | Excludes tax                | Includes all applicable taxes assuming a `Person` as a `customer` |
| Currencies usually associated                          | USD                         | EUR, AUD, GBP                 |
| Example price of opportunity before tax                | 10.00                       | 10.00                         |
| Example tax rate                                       | 0.2                         | 0.2                           |
| Price displayed to <a>Customer</a> during browsing (`Offer`)  | 10.00                       | 12.00                         |
| Total paid by <a>Customer</a> (`totalPaymentDue`)             | 12.00                       | 12.00                         |


## Free opportunities

Free opportunities, defined by those with at least one `Offer` with a `price` of `0`, MUST follow the same workflow as paid opportunities, except with no interaction with a <a>Payment Provider</a>, and no `payment` included in the Order Creation request.

For free `Offer`s publishers MAY not include `priceCurrency`. If a `priceCurrency` is not available then <a>Brokers</a> SHOULD display "Free" or equivalent when displaying a zero price.


## Offer overrides

The unit price of an `OrderItem` MAY be overridden to allow for business models with variable pricing (where price differs from list price).

The <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a> MUST have agreed an arrangement for offer overrides out-of-band, including which <a>Opportunities</a> and `Offer`s they may be applied to.

An `OfferOverride` type may be supplied by the <a>Broker</a> to the `acceptedOffer` property at **C1**, **C2** and **B**. When an `OfferOverride` is used, it MUST be used consistently between **C1**, **C2** and **B**, it MUST be used by the <a>Booking System</a> instead of `acceptedOffer` to calculate the tax and totals. It MAY be used for any `brokerRole`.

The `unitTaxSpecification` is calculated by the <a>Booking System</a> exactly as it would be for a standard `Offer`. The `price` of the `OfferOverride` may be zero, and also may be higher or lower than the available `Offer`s that exist in the <a>Booking System</a>.

`OfferOverride` MUST NOT be used when `isAccessibleForFree` is `true`, as free events cannot be overridden. Note that <a>Booking Systems</a> that only offer free opportunities MUST NOT implement `OfferOverride` support, and must always throw an error when it is used.

<pre class="example" title="Example of OfferOverride">
  "acceptedOffer": {
    "type": "OfferOverride",
    "description": "Winger space for Speedball.",
    "name": "Speedball winger position",
    "price": 10.00,
    "priceCurrency": "GBP"
  }
</pre>

# Order Operations

## Definition of an Open Booking 'bookable' Opportunity and Offer pair

Before entering into the Booking Flow, the <a>Customer</a> MUST have selected at least one <a>bookable</a> pair of an <a>Opportunity</a> ("Yoga Tuesday 14th 7pm") with an associated `Offer` ("Junior (8-18) Â£9"). These pairs populate the `acceptedOffer` and `orderedItem` properties within the `OrderItem`s.

The pairing of an <a>Opportunity</a> of type `Event`, `ScheduledSession`, `HeadlineEvent`, `Slot` or `CourseInstance` with an `Offer` is deemed to be <dfn>bookable</dfn> via the Open Booking API if the `Offer` is applicable to the <a>Opportunity</a> following the principles of `Offer` inheritance contained in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]], and if both the <a>Opportunity</a> and `Offer` meet the criteria specified below.

Bookable `Offer`s:

- `availableChannel` of the `Offer` includes `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingPrepayment`.

- `advanceBooking` of the `Offer` is not equal to `https://openactive.io/Unavailable`.

- The `Offer` is current based on `validFromBeforeStartDate`.

Bookable <a>Opportunities</a>:

- The `endDate` is not already in the past (note that bookings are still possible after the `startDate`).

- The `eventStatus` of the `Event`, `ScheduledSession`, or `Slot` is not `https://schema.org/EventCancelled` or `https://schema.org/EventPostponed`.

- The `remainingAttendeeCapacity` or `remainingUses` is greater than the number required.

- The `potentialAction` of dataset site includes an `OpenBookingAction` object.

- The `validFromBeforeStartDate` duration (if provided) subtracted from the `startDate` in the past. This allows for a "bookahead" window to be specified.

- The `taxMode` (`https://openactive/TaxNet` or `https://openactive/TaxGross`) is specified within the `Organization` that is included in the REQUIRED `organizer` or `provider` properties.

- The <a>Broker</a> has machine readable permission to access the relevant instance of a compliant Open Booking API provided by the <a>Booking System</a> via an API key or similar token.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT attempt to book an opportunity that is not <a>bookable</a> by the above criteria. The <a>Booking System</a> MUST include an `error` of value `UnavailableOpportunityError` against each `OrderItem` in the `OrderQuote` that is not <a>bookable</a>.

### Booking restrictions

Note that although the <a>Customer</a> may be ineligible to attend a <a>bookable</a> <a>Opportunity</a> via an associated <a>bookable</a> `Offer` based on the `genderRestriction` or `ageRange`, this specification encourages the <a>Broker</a> NOT to capture additional personal data about the <a>Customer</a> (e.g. gender and date of birth) and NOT to enforce validation of these restrictions using such data, but instead to prominently display clear messaging regarding such restrictions throughout the booking process to ensure that the <a>Customer</a> is aware of these and able to make an informed decision.

There may be additional restrictions placed on an <a>Opportunity</a> by the <a>Seller</a>. For example, it may be that one of the party must be over a certain age as a supervising adult if some of the party are minors. It is the responsibility of the <a>Booking System</a> and <a>Seller</a> to make such restrictions available as `attendeeInstructions` on the `SessionSeries`, `FacilityUse`, `Event`, `HeadlineEvent` or `CourseInstance`, and the <a>Broker</a> MUST display these instructions clearly during the booking process.

The <a>Broker</a> MAY filter the `Offer`s it displays, for example based on `ageRange` of the `Offer`, to increase the relevance of the `Offer`s displayed to the <a>Broker</a>'s audience.


## Amending the OrderQuote before **B**

The <a>Broker</a> MAY call **C1** and MUST call **C2** when the <a>Customer</a> updates their basket to add and remove items.

When repeated calls to **C1** or **C2** are made with the same UUID, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST update any associated lease to match the latest set of `OrderItem`s - be removing those `OrderItem` that are not present in the request from the lease, and adding those `OrderItem` that have been added since the last call to the lease.

Leases may be cancelled by the <a>Broker</a> as a courtesy by submitting an OrderQuote Deletion request using the same UUID. The <a>Broker</a> SHOULD make a reasonable attempt to cancel all leases when it is aware that a <a>Customer</a> has abandoned their journey, or if an error occurs and a new UUID is to be generated for the same customer. This increases the likelihood of an opportunity being booked with one space remaining.

For <a>Booking Systems</a> that have not implemented leasing, an OrderQuote Deletion request MUST simply return a 204 success status in all cases.

## Cancellation after **B**

Either the whole `Order` or individual `OrderItem`s within the `Order` may be cancelled after **B**, however `OrderItem`s cannot be replaced or added to an existing `Order` within this version of the specification.

The cancellation may be requested by either the <a>Customer</a> or the <a>Seller</a>, and results in an updated `Order` item on the <a>Orders feed</a>. Once a cancellation status is placed on an `OrderItem` within an `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a> it is assumed by the <a>Booking System</a> to have been processed, and it MUST NOT be reversed. A new `Order` will need to created to reinstate the booking.

### Refund after the opportunity has occurred 

Although a cancellation may be requested before the opportunity has occurred in order to trigger a refund, cancellation and refund after an opportunity has occurred is currently outside the scope of this specification.

Full and partial refunds after an opportunity has occurred MUST be handled out-of-band directly between the <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a>.

### Customer requested cancellation

<figure>
 <img src="customercancelled.png" alt="Customer requested cancellation">
 <figcaption>Customer requested cancellation</figcaption>
</figure>

To cancel an existing OrderItem, the <a>Broker</a> MUST:

1. Use the latest state of the `Order` stored during the booking flow and updated via the <a>Orders feed</a> to determine which `OrderItem`s may be cancelled and refunded. If `allowCustomerCancellationFullRefund` is `true` and `latestCancellationBeforeStartDate` subtracted from the opportunity `startDate` is in the future, a PATCH against the `Order` including the `OrderItem` with `"orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled"` SHOULD succeed.

2. Inform the <a>Customer</a> of the refund being requested before they commit to cancellation, using the existing data available in the stored `Order` to communicate the `OrderItem`s that are included in the full refund request. 

3. Submit a PATCH for the `Order` including only the `id` for each of the `OrderItem`s to be cancelled, with an `"orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled"` set on each. On success, a status code 204 response will be received, without any body. On failure a status code 400 response will be received, containing a `CancellationNotPermittedError` error including a `description` of the reason, which SHOULD be displayed to the <a>Customer</a>. 

4. Process any refunds based on the resulting updates to the <a>Orders feed</a>, based on the updated `totalPaymentDue`. Successfully cancelled `OrderItems` will have `orderItemStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled`. Note refunds MUST NOT be processed except in response to updates in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

To cancel an entire `Order`, the PATCH request MUST include `"orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled"` for each `OrderItem` within it.

Note that there is no provision for a <a>Customer</a> to cancel an `Order` after the cancellation window specified by `latestCancellationBeforeStartDate`. They may wish to do this out of politeness even though no refund is possible, with the benefit that their place may be taken by another participant, which can be included in future versions of this specification.


### Seller requested cancellation

<figure>
 <img src="sellercancelled.png" alt="Seller requested cancellation">
 <figcaption>Seller requested cancellation</figcaption>
</figure>

`OrderItems` cancelled by the <a>Seller</a> will have `orderItemStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and will optionally include a `cancellationMessage`. Refunds MUST be processed in response to the resulting updates in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and the <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified with the `cancellationMessage` if provided.



## Orders feed: Notifications, updates and refunds

An <dfn>Orders feed</dfn>, which is a secure [[RPDE]] feed of `Order`s, MUST be provided by the <a>Booking System</a>, with the contents of the feed specific to the authenticating <a>Broker</a>. This allows the <a>Broker</a> to maintain an updated state of all their bookings across a number of <a>Booking Systems</a>, even when changes are made outside of the <a>Broker</a>.

This also allows the <a>Broker</a> to handle refunds to cancellations, and process notifications to <a>Customers</a> in a consistent way.

## Order Feed Inconsistencies

An error condition exists where an unrecognised `Order` item is found by the <a>Broker</a> on the feed. Due to the `Order` being stored during the **Payment Authorisation** stage, there should always be a matching `Order` to any UUID on the <a>Orders feed</a> even if it has been soft-deleted. This would make an unrecognised `Order` an impossible scenario, and hence an unrecognised `Order` should be logged as a serious error within the <a>Broker</a> and promptly investigated.

## Order stores with eventual consistency

It is important that the storage used by the <a>Broker</a> for `Order`s provides a [linearizability](https://aphyr.com/posts/313-strong-consistency-models) guarantee when `Order`s are retrieved by ID, due to the partial updates that are applied to it from the <a>Orders feed</a> and the creation of the initial `Order` being synchronous.

### Booking System: Updating the Orders feed

The <a>Booking System</a> must ensure that the `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> represent the current state of `OrderItem`s within the system, for the properties included in the feed. Hence any change to any property within an `Order` in the feed must result in a change to the `modified` property associated with that `Order`.

### Broker: Processing the Orders feed

The <a>Broker</a> MUST maintain an up-to-date store of `Order`s received from the <a>Booking System</a>. Each `Order` received is compared to the last `Order` stored, and any differences between the old and new content trigger notifications and refunds to the <a>Customer</a>, as well as updating the <a>Broker</a>'s store.

Hence it is important for the <a>Broker</a> to consider their store of `Order`s as durable, and not simply a cache, to ensure their <a>Customers</a> always get relevant notifications.

Note that the properties included in the <a>Orders feed</a> MAY be a subset of the `Order` response from **B** (effectively making the <a>Orders feed</a> a series of PATCH requests for the <a>Broker</a>), it is the responsibility of the <a>Broker</a> to maintain a complete view of the `Order` state.

<a>Brokers</a> MUST harvest the <a>Orders feed</a> with a frequency of at least once every 60 seconds to ensure expediency of updates and notifications to <a>Customers</a>.

### New `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s

A new `Order` MUST NOT be displayed by the <a>Broker</a> and other operations such as cancellation MUST NOT be possible until it has reached the `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete`, after which the `orderCreationStatus` can be completely ignored.

New `OrderProposal`s MUST be stored by the <a>Broker</a> based on a successful response to the Order Proposal call.

New `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s are not included in the feed until they have been updated at least once. This minimises the volume of `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and allows the polling frequency of the feed to be greatly reduced, which reduces the overall load on the <a>Booking System</a>.

Hence all `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> will always be recognised by the <a>Broker</a> as updates to an existing stored `Order` or `OrderProposal`, and the <a>Broker</a> should treat any unrecognised `Order`s or `OrderProposal`s in the feed as a serious implementation error.


### Cancellation, refund calculation and notification

Regardless of the source of the cancellation, the process for refunding and notifying the <a>Customer</a> and updating the <a>Broker</a>'s records is exactly the same.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST process refunds for each new cancellation found in the feed, and it is the <a>Broker</a>'s responsibility to continually retry failed refund processing and escalate any processing failure to the <a>Customer</a> accordingly. Note that the <a>Orders feed</a> is "fire and forget" for the <a>Booking System</a>: once an `OrderItem` is updated with a cancellation status in the <a>Orders feed</a>, the status MUST not be reversed, and is assumed by the <a>Booking System</a> to be processed.

For `Order`s found with `OrderItem`s that contain `orderItemStatus` with new `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled` or `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` values and a new corresponding `totalPaymentDue` value, the <a>Broker</a> MUST instruct the <a>Payment Provider</a> to issue a new <a>Refund</a> such that the new `totalPaymentDue` value of the `Order` is equal to the value of the associated <a>Payment</a> less all <a>Refunds</a> including the new one.

The <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified after a refund is successfully processed, using the `orderItemStatus` to indicate the source of the cancellation.

If refund processing takes longer than 1 minute, and a new status of `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` was detected by the <a>Broker</a>, then the <a>Customer</a> must be notified immediately of a cancellation ahead of the notification of the completed refund. This ensures the <a>Seller</a> can rely on the <a>Broker</a> as a notification channel in the event of cancellation. The <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified with the `cancellationMessage` for the `OrderItem` if provided.

Note that the <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified in the event of all cancellations, even if no refund is due for free opportunities.

### Partial Refunds and out-of-band arrangements

This version of the specification does not allow a refund to be processed (in full or in part) by the <a>Booking System</a> without going via the <a>Broker</a> for any `Order` that has been placed via the <a>Broker</a>. <a>Booking Systems</a> MUST disable their own refund functionality for `Order`s placed via a <a>Broker</a> - only allowing Seller requested cancellations which trigger the <a>Broker</a> to provide full item refunds - to ensure that the book keeping and invoices of the <a>Broker</a> are not invalidated.

Partial refunds MAY be handled by out-of-band arrangements between the <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a> provided they do not have any affect on the Open Booking API interface. For example, the <a>Broker</a> could issue a partial refund and then reassign the remaining funds as a cancellation penalty via a new invoice handled and reconciled directly with the <a>Seller</a> outside the scope of the <a>Booking System</a> and this specification.


### Change of logistics notifications

The `orderedItem` within the `OrderItem` of the <a>Orders feed</a> includes an `id` reference to an opportunity, which may be found and cross-referenced with other sources of opportunity data, for example an [[RPDE]] open feed.

This specification does not require the <a>Orders feed</a> to include the full contents of the opportunities within the `orderedItem`, and hence the <a>Broker</a> MUST monitor the opportunity data feeds for this information and MUST provide a notification to the <a>Customer</a> for substantive changes to the opportunity (e.g. changes to `startDate`).


## Amending the Order after **B**

`OrderItem`s cannot be replaced or added to an existing `Order` within this version of the specification. A new `Order` must be created, and the old `Order` cancelled.

For the common case of rescheduling a `SessionSeries` or `FacilityUse` booking, the following steps are RECOMMENDED for the <a>Broker</a>:

1. Request an `OrderQuote` for the new `orderItem`s with a new UUID, using **C2**.

2. Check the latest stored state of `Order`s from the <a>Orders feed</a> to ensure that old `OrderItem` allows `allowCustomerCancellationFullRefund`.

3. Clearly display messaging to the <a>Customer</a> that explains that this transaction will involve a refund and new purchase, and so they will expect a refund for the old item and a new transaction for the new one. Information should be displayed to the <a>Customer</a> if any price difference exists between the two `Order`s, for the <a>Customer</a> to confirm.

4. Request new payment details from the <a>Customer</a> and Authorise the amount specified by **C2**, then PATCH the old `Order` via the Order Cancellation endpoint, and if successful, complete **B** as normal.

The new `Order` is completed as described in the Simple Booking Flow, and the existing `OrderItem` is cancelled with the refund processed as described elsewhere.


## Delivery of Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy

The <a>Broker</a> MUST make the <a>Customer</a> aware of any `termsOfService` provided within the `seller`, `broker`, and `bookingService` (which may include Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy) before the <a>Customer</a> confirms their purchase.

If `requiresExplicitConsent` is `true` for any `termsOfService` then the <a>Customer</a> MUST have explicitly acted to assent to such terms before the <a>Customer</a> completes **B**.

Since, during booking, the details of the <a>Customer</a> are provided to the <a>Booking System</a> and the <a>Seller</a>, the <a>Broker</a> MUST inform the <a>Customer</a> of this any implications with respect to GDPR and any other data protection legislation.

Note that `termsOfService` may only be specified at the `seller`, `broker` or `bookingService` level within the `Order`, and may not be provided for a specific `Offer` or `OrderItem`.

<pre class="example" title="Properties for Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy">
  "termsOfService": [
    {
      "type": "Terms",
      "name": "Privacy Policy",
      "url": "https://example.com/privacy-policy",
      "requiresExplicitConsent": false
    },
    {
      "type": "Terms",
      "name": "Terms and Conditions",
      "url": "https://example.com/terms-and-conditions",
      "requiresExplicitConsent": true
    }
  ]
</pre>

The URLs in the example are only illustrative.


## Access control

For opportunities that require entry into a restricted building or area to participate, it is REQUIRED that `OrderItem` include unique access control data within `accessCode` and `accessToken`. An `accessCode` SHOULD be provided for manual use in the event that an `accessToken` fails.

Each `accessCode` and `accessToken` MUST represent unique methods of entry, and MUST NOT be duplicated in different formats. For example, multiple formats (e.g. PNG, JPEG) of the same `accessToken` MUST NOT be supplied.

A <a>Broker</a> MUST make all supplied `accessToken`s and `accessCode`s available to the <a>Customer</a>, with the exception of `Barcode`s that do not have fallback image `url`. `Barcode`s without a `url` MAY be ignored if the <a>Broker</a> is unable to process them. 

### Text-based access control

PIN codes, Order identifiers, or simply the e-mail address of the <a>Customer</a> are all permissible for the purposes of access control.

In keeping with the Schema.org definition of `PropertyValue`, the `name` property SHOULD be used for the name of the property, and the `description` property SHOULD be used for any human-readable access control code(s). 

<pre class="example" title="Example of accessCode used for a PIN Code">
  "accessCode": [
    {
      "type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "PIN Code",
      "description": "1234"
    }
  ],
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Example of accessCode used for a booking reference">
  "accessCode": [
    {
      "type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "Booking Reference",
      "description": "123456789"
    }
  ],
</pre>

### Image-based access control

Images to be displayed to provide access, for example access tickets rendered by the booking system, MAY be included as an `ImageObject` within the `accessToken` array.

`ImageObject` MUST NOT be used for fallback images of a `Barcode`; the `url` property of the `Barcode` MUST be used for this purpose.

<pre class="example" title="Example of ImageObject in accessToken">
  "accessToken": [
    {
      "type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://access.example.com/476ac24c694da79c5e33731ebbb5f1"
    }
  ],
</pre>

### Extension point for barcode-based access control

Access barcodes to be rendered by the <a>Broker</a> MAY be included as a `Barcode` within the `accessToken` array. Note that `Barcode` subclasses `ImageObject`, allowing it to contain a fallback rendered barcode image `url` in addition to the raw barcode details. `Barcode`s SHOULD include a fallback image `url`.

Due to the variety of barcode formats available, the specification expects the `Barcode` to include additional properties using a custom namespace (as specified in the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification), enough to allow the barcode to be reproduced by the <a>Broker</a>. This will help inform future versions of the specification.

<pre class="example" title="Example of Barcode in accessToken">
  "accessToken": [
    {
      "type": "Barcode",
      "url": "https://fallback.image.example.com/476ac24c694da79c5e33731ebbb5f1",
      "text": "0123456789",
      "bookwhen:codeType": "code128"
    }
  ],
</pre>



## General extension mechanism

Additional OPTIONAL extension properties MAY be included in any request and response defined within this specification using a custom namespace (as specified in the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification), and the values of such extension properties MAY alter the behaviour of the API. However such extension properties MUST NOT be required and the API MUST function exactly according to this specification when these extension properties are completely omitted or ignored, in order to ensure full compatibility with this specification is retained.

Any extension properties defined for an API implementation MUST be fully documented, in order to ensure that the <a>Seller</a> has a complete view of the functionality it is exposing to the <a>Broker</a>.

# Endpoints

This API has been defined around the concept of URL discovery, using the [[Dataset-API-Discovery]] specification as a basis. This allows resource URLs which match the naming conventions of each <a>Booking System</a>.

## Paths and Verbs

Due to URL discovery, the paths of the endpoints below are illustrative, as the actual paths may vary provided they are consistent within an implementation.

A summary of endpoints defined by this specification is provided below:

| Endpoint Name                | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Example Path                   |
|------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| OrderQuote Creation **C1**   | REQUIRED    | Yes  | OrderQuote       | PUT       | `/order-quote-templates/{uuid}`|
| OrderQuote Creation **C2**   | REQUIRED    | Yes  | OrderQuote       | PUT       | `/order-quotes/{uuid}`         |
| OrderQuote Deletion          | REQUIRED    |      | OrderQuote       | DELETE    | `/order-quotes/{uuid}`         |
| OrderProposal Creation **P** | OPTIONAL    | Yes  | OrderProposal    | PUT       | `/order-proposals/{uuid}`      |
| OrderProposal Update         | OPTIONAL    |      | OrderProposal    | PATCH     | `/order-proposals/{uuid}`      |
| Order Creation **B**         | REQUIRED    | Yes  | Order            | PUT       | `/orders/{uuid}`               |
| Order Deletion               | REQUIRED    |      | Order            | DELETE    | `/orders/{uuid}`               |
| Order Cancellation           | REQUIRED    |      | Order            | PATCH     | `/orders/{uuid}`               |
| Orders RPDE Feed             | REQUIRED    | Yes  | Orders feed      | GET       | `/orders-rpde`                 |
| Order Status                 | RECOMMENDED | Yes  | Order            | GET       | `/orders/{uuid}`               |

Note that for simple implementation, OrderQuote Creation C1 and OrderQuote Creation C2 can be exactly the same endpoint.

### Order Endpoint RESTful Semantics

Note that practically all `Order` endpoints above (those that relate to `Order` or its subclasses `OrderQuote` and `OrderProposal`) share the same UUID namespace, and can be successfully implemented with a single underlying `Order` record behind them all. These endpoints are distinct purely to reduce the logic required in each and to increase testability and maintainability.

An `Order` with a particular UUID MUST only exist as either an `Order`, `OrderQuote` or `OrderProposal` at a single point in time.

Hence the Order Status endpoint SHOULD return any stored `Order`, `OrderQuote` or `OrderProposal` with that UUID, and the <a>Orders Feed</a> MUST return both `Order` and `OrderProposal` items (noting that `OrderQuote` are not included in the <a>Orders Feed</a>).

To aid the reader in their semantic reasoning, from a REST perspective, there are four resources:
- `/order-quote-templates` and `/order-quotes` - both are a collection resource of `OrderQuote`s. These are always ephemeral, so are created only for the duration of the PUT request, unless the <a>Booking System</a> chooses to persist them, in which case they exist until the lease expires or an `OrderProposal` or `Order` is created.
- `/order-proposals` - a collection resource of `OrderProposal`s, which are deleted when a corresponding `Order` is created.
- `/orders` - a collection resource of `Order`s which includes its subclasses `OrderQuote`s and `OrderProposal`s



## Request and Response

This section includes request and response examples for each of the endpoints specified in this API.

### Order Creation

| Endpoint Name          | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path                                     |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Order Creation         | REQUIRED    | Order            | PUT       | `/orders/{uuid}`                                 |

The <dfn>Order Creation</dfn> is an essential part of the Booking Flow, allowing creation of an `Order` via an `OrderQuote`.

It is not possible for opportunities from different <a>Sellers</a> or with different <a>Brokers</a> or on behalf of different <a>Customers</a> to be combined in the same `Order`.

Note that the `broker` property in the request body is to help the <a>Booking System</a> to clarify who is making request and to help them in situations such as queries to allow reconciliation of payments. It is not designed as any part of an authentication which MUST be performed outside of the JSON body of the request. Authentication tokens MUST NOT be present within the `broker` property of the submitted JSON.

In the situation where a middleware is used for various <a>Brokers</a>, independently of API key provisioning at the <a>Booking System</a> level, the `broker` property SHOULD contain the details of the end-user <a>Broker</a> rather than the middleware.


#### `OrderQuote`

A PUT request to the Order Creation endpoint of the <a>Booking System</a> with an object of type `OrderQuote` will return a `OrderQuote` which represents a "dry run" of the booking, with the state of the `Order` identical to if request of type `Order` be made, without any side effects (with the exception of optional leasing).

Note that the <a>Booking System</a>Â MUST NOT store any personal information of the `customer` provided for the `OrderQuote` past the expiry of any associated lease created.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: OrderQuote example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationRequest">
</pre>

If successful the <a>Booking System</a> will respond with an OrderQuote:

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: OrderQuote example success response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationResponse">
</pre>

If there are any issues with the `OrderItem`s requested in the `OrderQuote`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `409 Conflict` response (as the error is expected to be resolved, and the request resubmitted, as per [[RFC2616]]), with `error` details provided against each offending `OrderItem`. Note that `totalPaymentDue` and `totalPaymentTaxSpecification` MUST be calculated excluding any `OrderItem`s that include `error`s.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: OrderQuote example OrderItem error response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationOrderItemErrorResponse">
</pre>

If there are issues with other properties of the `OrderQuote` outside of `orderedItem`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a JSON-LD response which includes only the appropriate `OpenBookingError` and the appropriate status code.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: OrderQuote example failure response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationErrorResponse">
</pre>


#### `Order`

A PUT request to the Order Creation endpoint of the <a>Booking System</a> with an object of type `Order` will create the `Order` and complete the booking from the point of the view of the <a>Booking System</a>.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: Order example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationRequest">
</pre>

If successful the server will respond with the location of a newly created `Order` resource.

For the `Order` response and the <a>Orders feed</a>, the `OrderItems` MUST include a unique `id`. This allows `OrderItem`s to be cancelled individually once the `Order` has been created.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: Order example minimal response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationResponse">
</pre>

Both `OrderQuote` and `Order` responses can optionally reflect back properties provided by the <a>Booking System</a> for completeness, for example:

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: Order example full response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationFullResponse">
</pre>

If there are issues any properties of the `Order`, including the `orderedItem`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `400 Bad Request` response which includes only the appropriate `Error`. The <a>Broker</a> is expected to retry the `OrderQuote` to get specific `orderedItem` level errors.

### Order Proposal



### Order Deletion

| Endpoint Name          | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path         |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Order Deletion         | REQUIRED    | Order            | DELETE    | `/orders/{uuid}`     |

Deleting an `Order` allows for the whole Booking Flow to be reversed for fatal error and testing scenarios.

When an `Order` is deleted the <a>Booking System</a> SHOULD hard delete it as if it was not created, but MAY soft delete it providing all related personal data is purged. The audit for the deletion is guaranteed to be stored in the <a>Broker</a> in all cases.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT use Order Deletion for cancellation, but instead only use it in the unusual case of a fatal error or testing. An appropriate approach for cancellation is defined elsewhere.

The corresponding `Order` MUST be marked as `deleted` in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

<pre class="example" title="Order Deletion: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderDeletionRequest">
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Order Deletion: example response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderDeletionResponse">
</pre>


### Order Cancellation

| Endpoint Name          | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path         |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Order Cancellation     | REQUIRED    | Order            | PATCH     | `/orders/{uuid}`     |

All other properties except the `id` and `orderItemStatus` inside the `OrderItem` MUST be ignored. `OrderItem`s omitted from the PATCH request MUST also be ignored.

The cancellation may be requested:

<pre class="example" title="Order Cancellation: example Order request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCancellationRequest">
</pre>

The cancellation request succeeds and fails atomically.

<pre class="example" title="Order Cancellation: example success response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCancellationSuccessResponse">
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Order Cancellation: example error response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCancellationErrorResponse">
</pre>




### Orders RPDE Feed

| Endpoint Name          | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path         |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Orders RPDE Feed       | REQUIRED    | Orders feed      | GET       | `/orders-rpde`       |

<pre class="example" title="Order RPDE Feed: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderFeedRequest">
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Order RPDE Feed: example response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderFeedResponse">
</pre>


### Order Status

A <a>Booking System</a> SHOULD provide an endpoint to allow a <a>Broker</a> to retrieve complete `Order`s. In future versions of the specification, endpoints may be provided which permit a <a>Broker</a> to see all `Order`s created by a <a>Customer</a>. In this current implementation, the <a>Broker</a> MUST keep its own record of `Order`s as described elsewhere in this specification, and not rely on this RECOMMENDED Order Status endpoint.

| Endpoint Name          | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path          |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| Order Status           | RECOMMENDED | Order            | GET       | `/orders/{uuid}`      |

<pre class="example" title="Order Status: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderStatusRequest">
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Order Status: example response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderStatusResponse">
</pre>



### URL discovery

Discovery of URLs is an implicit part of the design of this specification, and <a>Brokers</a> SHOULD avoid hard-coding URLs for specific actions into their applications and client libraries. <a>Brokers</a> SHOULD use most applicable URL discovered at the point in the workflow they are currently in - e.g. not use a cached URL that has been previously successfully used. They should also not attempt to create URLs for a specific action based on patterns within previously used URLs.

It is the responsibility of <a>Booking Systems</a> to advertise the URL for further activity in the booking workflow at the point of need or via the [[Dataset-API-Discovery]] specification. For example they MUST advertise the URL for the `Order` resource in the Orders <a>Orders feed</a> by including the `id` property within the `Order`.

# Model

These models are designed compatible with [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]], and includes conformance criteria that are both stricter and more relaxed when existing models are used in the context of this specification.

### `oa:OpenBookingError` subclasses

A number of `OpenBookingError` subclasses are specified to identify the problem type.


#### Order Creation - `OrderQuote` and `Order` error responses

| Error Type                                  | Status Code | Use Case                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IncompleteCustomerDetailsError`            | 400         | If the `email` address of the <a>Customer</a> is not supplied within a `schema:Person` object; or if the `customer` property supplied is not a valid `schema:Person` or `schema:Organization` object. |
| `IncompleteAttendeeDetailsError`            | 400         | If the `attendeeDetailsRequired` properties of the `attendee` are not supplied within a `schema:Person` object. |

| Error Type                                  | Status Code | Use Case                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CancellationNotPermittedError`             | 400         | The cancellation is not permitted due to internal rules of the <a>Booking System</a> not otherwise exposed to the `Broker`. The `description` property of the object MUST include a <a>Customer</a>-facing description of the reason that cancellation is not permitted. |



#### Order Creation - `OrderItem` errors

Note that all `OrderItem` errors for an `OrderQuote` request result in a `409 Conflict` response, as the error is expected to be resolved, and the request resubmitted, as per [[RFC2616]] section 10.4.10.

| Error Type                                  | Status Code | Use Case                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `UnacceptableOfferError`                    | 409         | If the `acceptedOffer` is not a URL which corresponds to an applicable `Offer` for the opportunity. |
| `UnknownOfferError`                         | 409         | If the `acceptedOffer` is not a URL which corresponds to an `Offer` within the <a>Booking System</a>. |
| `UnknownOpportunityDetailsError`            | 409         | If the `orderedItem` is not a URL which corresponds to an opportunity on the <a>Booking System</a>. |
| `UnavailableOpportunityError`               | 409         | If the `Offer` contained in the `acceptedOffer` property is not <a>bookable</a>. |
| `OpportunityIsInConflictError`              | 409         | If the specific `orderedItem`s against which this error is emitted are not able to be booked together. |
| `OpportunityIsFullError`                    | 409         | If there are no available spaces for the opportunity contained in the `orderedItem` property. |
| `OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError`   | 409         | If there are not enough available spaces in the opportunity contained in the `orderedItem` property of the `OrderItem` to fulfil the number of repeated `OrderItem`s. If the `OrderItem` is repeated (for multiple attendees) this error must only be displayed against the `OrderItem`s which are in excess of the capacity - for example in an <a>Opportunity</a> with a `remainingAttendeeCapacity` of 2 and with 5 `OrderItem`s related to it, this error would only be emitted against 3 of the `OrderItem`s. |


#### API authentication

| Error Type                                  | Status Code | Use Case                                                                                                                                                                                       |

# Common Requirements

This section defines some common functionality that applies to the design of the
whole API.

## Media types


Custom media types are used in this API to allow clients to choose the format
of the data they receive, and for <a>Booking Systems</a> to stipulate which versions
of the specification they support.

<a>Booking Systems</a> MAY choose to support additional media types but MUST support the
media type(s) defined by this specification.

Media types will conform to the following pattern:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json; model=[m], booking=[b], rpde=[r]
```

The current media type is:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json; model=2.0, booking=1.0, rpde=1.0
```

 <a>Brokers</a> specifying a media type without a version, such as:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json
```

will receive data in in the most current format.

If you are building an application as a <a>Broker</a> and care about the stability
of the response, or have a client application which is tied to a specific
version you should always try to use a media type containing the version number.


<div class="issue" data-number="93"></div>


## Response formats

Requests and response documents exchanged via this API will all be valid
[[!JSON-LD]] documents, with the exception of the <a>Orders feed</a>, where only documents
included in the `data` property are valid [[!JSON-LD]].

The [[!JSON-LD]] documents MUST include a [[!JSON-LD]] `context` that refers
to the [[!OpenActive-Vocabulary]] as follows:

<pre class="example" title="minimal JSON-LD document">
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/"
}
</pre>

Unless otherwise specified the request and response documents MUST conform to
the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] data model.


## Errors

Error responses MUST be served using an appropriate HTTP 4XX status code or HTTP 5XX status code specified in the model.

All error responses from this API MUST be returned in a JSON-LD format subclass of the `OpenBookingError` using a content type of `application/vnd.openactive+json` (optionally including any version parameters).

<pre class="example" title="Error response example" data-transform="dataExampleErrorResponse">
</pre>


## Rate Limiting

The <a>Booking System</a> MAY choose to apply rate limiting for each unique set of authentication credentials. In such circumstances where a request is rate limited, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST return a response with status code 429.

To allow for a broad range of API management solutions to be used, the <a>Broker</a> MUST rely only on the status code 429 when detecting and retrying a rate-limited request, as specified elsewhere in this specification. The following guidance is included to encourage convergence in implementations where possible. 

All rate-limited responses from this API SHOULD return a JSON-LD format `TooManyRequestsError` object using a content type of `application/vnd.openactive+json` (optionally including any version parameters) with status code 429.

The response SHOULD also include the `Retry-After` HTTP Header with a value set to the number of seconds after which the <a>Broker</a> SHOULD retry as per [[RFC2616]] section 14.37. 

<pre class="example" title="Rate limited response example" data-transform="dataExampleRateLimitResponse">
</pre>


## Security

Although this specification does not mandate a specific means of securing an API, it does mandate that at a minimum all HTTP requests and responses MUST be secured using SSL.


## Authentication

### API level authentication and data security

All of the API transactions described in this document MUST require authentication.

The content and data available to all endpoints provided by the <a>Booking System</a> MUST be specific to the authentication credentials, to ensure that bookings are secure. It is the responsibility of the <a>Booking System</a> to ensure that only authentication credentials that created an `Order` can amend and cancel the `Order`.

Note that a client using the same authentication credentials may represent more than one <a>Broker</a>, and the <a>Booking System</a> MUST make no assumptions regarding which <a>Broker</a> is being represented by a particular set of credentials. For the avoidance of doubt: the same <a>Broker</a> accessing a <a>Booking System</a> using two sets of credentials MUST not be able to access `Order`'s created by one set of credentials when using the other.

In terms of implementation, all data partitioning and security MUST be based on the authentication credentials; the `broker` property within the `Order` is for information only.

This specification does not mandate a particular authentication method, but its recommendation is that implementers SHOULD consider using [[OAuth2]] as it is well-defined, widely supported and can be used in a variety of different application flows (e.g. via a Javascript web application or between servers).

Other server-to-server authentication mechanisms such as basic authentication, API key or bearer token based mechanisms are also appropriate.


### <a>Customer</a> level authentication

OpenID Connect ([[OpenIdConnect]]) is recommended as standard way of verifying the identity of <a>Customer</a>. It is a thin layer that sits atop OAuth2.

One principle relating to authentication and the Booking API is that `Order`s created by a specific <a>Customer</a> SHOULD NOT be able to be changed by any other <a>Customer</a>. It is the responsibility of the <a>Broker</a> to ensure that subsequent requests to an `Order` should only be initiated by the <a>Customer</a> which created the `Order`.
